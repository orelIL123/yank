# Boiler Room - HomeScreen Mockup (React + Vite)

This is a minimal React project (Vite) containing a single screen mockup named `HomeScreen` for the Boiler Room app.

## Features
- Premium, spiritual aesthetic: black, red, green
- Header with gradient and subtitle
- 2x3 card grid with icons, soft shadows, light 3D tilt on hover
- Gentle fade-in animation on mount
- Bottom navigation sketch with red accent on active tab

## Tech
- React 18, Vite
- Icons via `react-icons`
- Font: Poppins (Google Fonts)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Build for production: `npm run build`
4. Preview production build: `npm run preview`

Open the dev server URL that appears in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

## Notes
- Navigation is only visual. No routing or business logic is implemented.
- All styles are in `src/styles.css`. The `HomeScreen` component is in `src/HomeScreen.jsx`.
